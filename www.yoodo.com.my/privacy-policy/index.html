Unless you have chosen to block your phone number, or have a silent line, CND will usually cause your phone number to be displayed (or logged) – locally and sometimes internationally – on a receiving caller's phone. In other words, CND will enable the disclosure of your phone number to receiving callers (and to other network operators) locally and internationally, unless you take the above measures. If you do not wish to disclose your number to persons receiving your call, you may subscribe to our Caller Line Identification Restriction (CLIR) service at prescribed fees.</p> </li> <li class=main data-label=13><div><h3>LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES</h3></div><p>If any part of our websites link you to other websites, those other websites do not operate under this Notice and we do not accept any responsibility or liability arising from those other websites.Likewise, if you subscribe to an application, content, a service or a product from our preferred merchant or strategic partners and you subsequently provide your Personal Data directly to that third party, that Personal Data will be subject to that third party's privacy/personal data protection notice or policy (if they have such a notice or policy) and not to this Notice.We recommend that you to read and understand the privacy/personal data protection notices/policies of those merchants or strategic partners in order for you to understand their procedures for collecting, processing, using and disclosing personal data and before submitting your Personal Data to themIf you have any questions in relation to this Privacy Notice, please contact us via email: support@yoodo.com.my</p> </li></ul></div></div><div class=vc_empty_space   style="height: 32px"><span class=vc_empty_space_inner></span></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer id=footer class=footer><div class="container px-5 px-md-0"><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-5 col-lg-3"><div class=row><div class=col-6><div class="font-weight-bold main-link-title">Links</div><div class="d-flex flex-column nav-link"> <a href=https://support.yoodo.com.my/hc/en-us>Get Help</a></div></div><div class=col-6><div class="font-weight-bold main-link-title">Company</div><div class="d-flex flex-column nav-link"> <a href=../about-us/index.html>About Us</a> <a href=../contact-us/index.html >Contact Us</a> <a href=../careers/index.html >Careers</a></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-auto d-flex flex-column justify-content-between pt-5 pt-md-0" style="margin-right: 40px;"><div><div class="font-weight-bold main-link-title">Follow us</div><div class="d-flex justify-content-left align-items-center media-social"><div class=mr-3> <a target=_blank href=https://www.facebook.com/yoodoMY/ > <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/facebook-icon.svg class=icon> </a></div><div class=mr-3> <a target=_blank href=https://www.instagram.com/yoodomy/ > <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/instagram-icon.svg class=icon> </a></div><div class=mr-3> <a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/yoodoMY> <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/twitter-icon.svg class=icon> </a></div><div class=mr-3> <a target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/c/yoodomy> <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/youtube-icon.svg class=icon> </a></div><div> <a target=_blank href=https://www.tiktok.com/@yoodomy> <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/tiktok-icon.svg class=icon> </a></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md d-flex flex-column justify-content-between pt-5 pt-md-0"><div class="looking-for mt-0 mt-md-4 mt-lg-0"><div class="mt-3 mt-md-0 font-weight-bold main-link-title">Can't find what you're looking for?</div><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8 pt-4 pt-md-0 px-0"> <a href=https://support.yoodo.com.my/hc/en-us/requests/new target=_blank><div class="d-flex align-items-start icon-box"> <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/ticket-red.svg> <img src=../wp-content/themes/yoodo/assets/img/svg/ticket.svg><div class=ml-3><div class="font-weight-bold mb-1">Submit a Ticket</div><div class="description mt-2 mb-3">Ticket submitted after operating hours will receive a response on the next working day.</div><div class=description>(Mon - Fri 9am - 6pm except Pub.
